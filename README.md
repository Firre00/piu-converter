# piu-converter
This converter converts from the file format ssc (used by the program arrow vortex) to ucs (used by the game pump it up). 
To use it, either drag your ssc files on it or open it and type the file path of the file. 

The list.txt file is a file that includes the offsets of all the songs in the game, if you keep it in the same directory as the converter it will use those offsets.
